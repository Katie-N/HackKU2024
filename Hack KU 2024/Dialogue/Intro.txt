Log Date XXXX: Earth- a microscopic orb floating around in the middle of nowhere. For a brief moment in history, a semi-intelligent species has emerged with the potential to become a full fledged member of the intergalactic species catalog. The only problem is… They’re advancing at a pace too fast for their ecosystem to maintain. As a last resort, you have been sent to discreetly assist the up and coming scientific community. Your job is to collect as much data as you can for us, the management team, and submit this data to Earth’s scientists in hopes that they can recognize patterns in your’s and all your coworker’s observations and learn how to balance their quick advancements with the needs of the other species. Remember, on Earth, one species cannot survive without the other, so we must help them learn balance before they can reach the great beyond. We’ve set you up with all the basic necessities, and our informant, Crow, will be available for assistance if needed.

Best of luck,

The Management Team
